# DoCSoc Mums & Dads v3

Nuxt4 + Hono application for the Mums & Dads website. Mums & Dads is a _course_-long scheme where freshers are allocated with parents (2nd, 3rd and 4th year students) and parents advice their children about the course, the college, the societies and much more.

Mad3 is a fork of [mad2](https://github.com/icdocsoc/mad2), re-written for the greater good of the society. Mad2 being 5 years ago, mad3 is written to adapt to newer web technologies and frameworks. This stack also aligns with ICHack '25 so one can see the resemblence in code style and structure.

This project is open-source and free to look at. If you wish to change something about the website, you can open a PR and we shall review it.

## Project structure

Although using Nuxt 3, we have opted to use Nuxt 4 in our build. [`app/`](/app/) contains the frontend while the [`hono/`](/hono/) contains the server.

## Local development

You must have bun installed. Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
# bun
bun install
```

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
bun --bun run dev
```
